# NBSEditor
## STATUS: WORKING
IF NOT WORKING PLEASE GO TO https://garbomuffin.github.io/nbsplayer/ TO USE A WORKING VERSION OF THIS APP

### Heroku app delpoy: Failed
I have not yet figured out how to do that. Until then, this will continue to be hosted on Github Pages.

***FROM HERE, IT IS BETA. SOME FEATURES ARE NOT YET INTEGRATED***
### This app runs in FoxxOS. Toolware-Advanced also supports NBSEditor
***THIS ONLY WORKS WITH CHROME!!!***
To run in **FoxxOS**, open a command line and type:
```batchfile
cd path/to/app/FoxxOS/run/foxxrun.bat
foxxrun init
foxxrun appType/WebApp/NBSEditor.bat
```
A browser will open with NBSEditor. You can now run your app.
To use Toolware-Advanced, open the chrome extension and good to go!
