    <h1>About NBSEditor</h1>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>NBSEditor was written in 2018 by <a href="https://github.com/garbomuffin">GarboMuffin (Thomas Weber)</a>. I aquired a copy in late 2019, as a largely abandoned project. I then started rebuilding, refactoring, and reshaping the app once known as <a href="https://github.com/garbomuffin/nbsplayer">nbsplayer</a>. It is now what it is today!</p>
    <h3>App Status</h3>
    <p>Current Status: Working</p>
    <h3>Developers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Garbomuffin - Role: Initial Builder/Creator (Rt.)</li>
      <li>Travis CI Deployment Bot - Role: branch master to gh-pages deploment (Rt.)</li>
      <li>TheGreatFoxxy - Role: Current Builder (Active)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Some hacks</h3>
    <p>While using the app myself, I've discovered some hacks. Here are some of them!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zooming out does help with how many blocks can fit into the screen, and how many layers on the side</li>
      <li>If the startup sound dosent play, click the red refresh page button, and it will play! (maybe. its kinda intermittent)</li>
      <li>Recording with a screen recorder does, and will capture the audio in very high quality, depending on your screen recorder</li>
    </ul>
